# What is Go?

Go, also known as Golang, is a modern programming language created by Google engineers: Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson, around 2007. It was officially released as an open source language in 2009.

## Why Go was created?

Google had a problem. Its engineers were building massive systems using C++ and Java and both had serious issues:

- C++ was powerful but painfully slow to compile.
- Java had faster development cycles but came with runtime bloat and complex dependency management.

They created a lanaguage that is fast like C, simple like Python and scalable for modern and multicore systems. Thus, Go, a pragmatic, compiled, statically typed language that emphasizes simplicity, concurrency and speed was born.

## Core Design Philosophy

1. Simplicity over cleverness
2. Fast Compilation
3. Concurrency as first class citizen
4. Simplicity in depenedency management
5. Stability and readablity

## Applications

- Cloud services and microservices
- DevOps tools (Docker, Kubernetes were written in Go)
- Command line tools
- Networking and backend systems
